0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:05,000
The bear and the bee.

0:00:05,000 --> 0:00:11,000
A version of the tale by thefablecoverage.com.

3
0:00:11,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Everybody knows that bears love honey.

4
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:22,000
One day Mr. Bear looks in his cupboard and he can't find any honey.

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Oh no, no honey.

6
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
He says.

7
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So he goes into the forest to find some.

8
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He sees a bee hive in a tree.

9
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He smells the honey.

10
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Hmm, honey.

11
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He sticks his paw into the bee hive and...

12
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:50,000
A bee flies out.

13
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Hey Bear, go away!

14
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Says the bee.

15
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This is not your honey.

16
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:00,000
Mr. Bear is annoyed.

17
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I am bigger than you.

18
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,000
He says.

19
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I am stronger than you too.

20
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I can do what I want.

21
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:10,000
No buzz off.

22
0:01:10,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Mr. Bear sticks his paw into the bee hive again.

23
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And...

24
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Zeng!

25
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Zeng!

26
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:20,000
Howie!

27
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The bee stings him right on his nose.

28
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
My nose!

29
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My nose!

30
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:30,000
Oh, I am so angry!

31
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Growls Mr. Bear.

32
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He finds a big stick.

33
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
He tries to hit the bee.

34
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
He swings and he swings, but the bee is too fast.

35
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Mr. Bear gets angrier and angrier.

36
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:50,000
I will squash you.

37
0:01:50,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Come here!

38
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The bee flies back into the bee hive.

39
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Oh, no, you're trapped!

40
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Yells Mr. Bear.

41
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
He swings his stick at the bee hive.

42
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Nash, smash, smash!

43
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He smashes it to pieces.

44
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Then he hears a strange sound.

45
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It gets louder and louder.

46
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Zeng!

47
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That was the bee.

48
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Thousands of bees fly out of the smashed bee hive.

49
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:30,000
They fly around Mr. Bear's head.

50
0:02:30,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Zeng!

51
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They sting him on his ear.

52
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Zeng?

53
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:40,000
They sting him on his elbow.

54
0:02:40,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They chase Mr. Bear through the forest.

55
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They sting him on his arms.

56
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:51,000
His legs, his hands, and especially on his nose.

57
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Mr. Bear runs all the way home and slams the door shut.

58
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Bam!

59
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Then he hears a voice behind him.

60
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It smises Bear.

61
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You did it again, didn't you?

62
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
She says.

63
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You lost your temper.

64
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Yes?

65
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
He says, as he cries and counts his bee stings.

66
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Here's the bee sting medicine, says Mrs. Bear.

67
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Also, we have honey in the cupboard.

68
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's behind the flower.

69
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Moral.

70
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:34,000
A hot temper always gets you into trouble.
